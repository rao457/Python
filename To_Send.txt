Aslam : Assalam-O-Alaikum, Atif How are you?
Atif: Wa-Alaikum Salam! I am good. What about you?
Aslam: Fine. Have you watched news today about flood in different regions of country?
Atif: Yes brother. It is pathetic. Now government is securing the people there but there has happened a big loss of lives and belongings of people.
Aslam: You are right. I think to avoid such losses government should promote awareness about measures during such circumstances.
Atif : Like, government should make public announcements in the areas where flood is pending.
Aslam: People must be told the secure areas around them they can go immediately if any emergency occurs.
Atif: Public authorities must cooperate with awareness teams to guide the area as soon as possible.
Aslam: I think taking these measures may save people from such losses in such natural disasters.
Atif: You are right brother. I gotta go home. See you soon. Allah Hafiz!
Aslam: Allah Hafiz!
